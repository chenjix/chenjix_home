Hi there! I am a third-year undergraduate student at Nanjing University, majoring in Software Engineering. Currently I'm working as a Research Assistant at the [XLANG Lab](https://www.xlang.ai/) (as part of the [HKU NLP Group](https://hkunlp.github.io/)) with [Prof. Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/). Before that, I have worked as a research intern with [Prof. Shujian Huang](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/huangsj/) at Nanjing University.

My research interests lie in ML and NLP. Nowadays, I am working on benchmarking Multimodal Language Models as agents. Here is the problem I am thinking about:

* How to design smarter GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLM)?
